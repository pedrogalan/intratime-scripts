# INTRODUCTION

This is (or is meant to be) a simple script to check the current status of the Intratime app, the application I use to track my working hours.

*This script does not and will never update the status of Intratime. It is and will always be a way to read information and raise notifications in case something suspicious is found (e.g. a unusually long pause).*

It is not functional yet, still in development. Feel free to add your comments or pull requests.

Use it under your own responsibility.

# TO DO

* Make it compatible with multiple operating systems (move to Python?).
* Add proper logic (at the moment is simply fetching the last action and checking the date).
* Make it send some kind of notification.
